# Membership Operators

# Consider a string variable named 'text'.
text = "Hello, world!"

# in Operator:
# The 'in' operator checks if a substring exists within a given string.
# Here, we check if the substring "world" is present within the string 'text'.
# If the substring "world" is found within the string,
# the result will be True, indicating that "world" is in 'text'.
# If the substring "world" is not found within the string,
# the result will be False.
print("in Operator:")
print("'world' in text:", 'world' in text)

# not in Operator:
# The 'not in' operator checks if a substring does not exist within a given string.
# Similarly, we check if the substring "Python" is not present within the string 'text'.
# If the substring "Python" is not found within the string,
# the result will be True, indicating that "Python" is not in 'text'.
# If the substring "Python" is found within the string,
# the result will be False.
print("\nnot in Operator:")
print("'Python' not in text:", 'Python' not in text)
